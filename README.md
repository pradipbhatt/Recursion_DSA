*This repo is For Recursion Hanoi program <br>
This C program uses a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi. The tower of hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. Puzzle begins with all disks stacked on one rod in decreasing order and the task is to move all these disks on some other rod obeying the following rules.

*Only one disk may be moved at a time. <br>
*Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. <br>
*No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
